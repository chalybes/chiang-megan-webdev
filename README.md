Web Dev Repo for NEU CS5610 

I'm a research tech who's currently enrolled in NEU's Bioinformatics MS program. Luckily enough I do have a little bit of a coding experience from my undergrad years and work, but my HTML/CSS knowledge is very outdated. This repository will mostly serve as the place where my CS5610 assignments go but I do have a website and building an app for my website will be my major project.
